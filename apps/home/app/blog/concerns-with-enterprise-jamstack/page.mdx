When heading out on your own to sink or swim for the first time as a Highly Paid Consultant (HPC), it helps to be over-prepared with solutions to these common pitfalls, challenges, and concerns with JAMStack in the enterprise.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

- CI/CD Pipelines
- Containerized builders & runtime environments
- Distributed secrets management
- Code quality and coverage reporting

Continuous integration and deployment involve validating code changes, processing them into release artifacts (e.g., building the project(s)), and publishing those artifacts to a specified environment.

Typically, there are at least two implicit environments: `development` (local) and `production` (remote). Other standard options are `preview,` `staging,` or `next`. Project-wide configuration values are a product of the defaults and current environment.

### Developer Tooling

- Containerized application builders and runtimes
- Portable developer environments (GitPod, Dev Container, etc.)
- Automated linting & formatting
- Task orchestration (Ant, Gradle, Nx, Jenkins, Make, etc.)

While it may sound unintuitive, tool quality and user preference are rarely the determining factor or a significant concern for large organizations. Consistency, reproducibility, automation, and interoperability with other tools are more important considerations.

In addition to detailed platform-specific documentation in the README, projects often include an entire development environment for easy setup and guaranteed reproducibility [3]. Both GitPod and Microsoft Dev Container bundle a copy of Theia IDE, a web-based VSCode clone intended for this purpose.

### Domain Modeling

- Schema definitions & data validation
- Change management (versioning)
- Transaction management (consistency)
- Relational data vs. document stores
- Automatic code generation

### Design Systems

- Shared design vocabulary between stakeholders
- Design tokens are decisions codified as data

### User Authentication & Authorization

- User authentication providers (SSO, OAuth2, LDAP, etc.)
- Role-based access protocols
- Distributed identity management and access control

### Content Management

- Version control & revision management (branching, merging, release, etc)
- Role-based access controls
- Environment-based configuration

### Reporting & Observability

- Automated logging report retention
- Usage of dead letter queues
